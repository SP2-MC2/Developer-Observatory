        <p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
        <p>Thank you for participating in our study. We are interested in learning about how developers solve certain programming tasks in Python.</p>
<p>As part of this study, we will assign you three short Python programming tasks to complete. These should take less than an hour. We ask that you write and test code directly in your browser, in an online Python editor provided for this purpose. We will explain the editor soon. After you complete the tasks, you will be directed to a short exit interview.</p>
<p>We hope that participating in this study will be both fun and educational. We are very grateful for your donation of time and effort to help our research.</p>
